{"name":"Egress-foundation","tagline":"Start writing a web app already, with Zurb's Foundation framework","body":"egress-foundation: start writing a web app already.\r\n====\r\n\r\negress-foundation is a minimal [Express](http://expressjs.com/) app template for a user account system, built with Twitter's foundation.\r\nI built this with the intention of getting user-based node.js apps scaffolded out quickly.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <th>Branch</th>\r\n        <th>Build Status</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Master</td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <img src=\"https://travis-ci.org/shakeelmohamed/egress-foundation.png?branch=master\" />\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td>Develop</td>\r\n        <td>\r\n            <img src=\"https://travis-ci.org/shakeelmohamed/egress-foundation.png?branch=develop\" />\r\n        </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n* The best way to use egress-foundation is by using the [Yeoman generator](http://github.com/shakeelmohamed/generator-egress)\r\n* This package was not meant to be installed through npm\r\n    * But, you can run `npm install egress-foundation`, then copy the contents of the `node_modules/egress-foundation` folder to the root of your project directory and follow the steps below\r\n    * Or, you can clone this project in the root of your project directory by running `git clone git@github.com/shakeelmohamed/egress-foundation.git`\r\n* You don't need to declare this module as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file.\r\n\r\n## Current problems (marked with a TODO)\r\n\r\n* There is no significant input validation in place, I suggest using [validator.js](https://github.com/chriso/validator.js) since it's already being used in the browser - located at [public/js/validator.min.js](public/js/validator.min.js).\r\nSee the current validation in [public/js/egress-validators.js](public/js/egress-validators.js)\r\n\r\n### Getting Started:\r\n\r\n1. If it does not exist, create a `.env` file in the root directory of this project.\r\n2. Your `.env` file should contain your PostgreSQL connection string in the following format, the `?ssl=true` query parameter is necessary only if your database connection requires SSL (Heroku's databases do) and will default to false if omitted:\r\n    ```\r\n    DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>?ssl=true\r\n    ```\r\nThis will allow your application to connect to your database\r\n\r\n3. Modify the `config` object in `config.js` to modify the application settings.\r\n4. Running `foreman start` will serve the application on the post listed in config.js (defaulting to 5000),\r\nand process the `DATABASE_URL` variable, locally. *Alternatively, running `node app.js` will do the same thing if you don't want to use foreman.*\r\n\r\n### Deploying to Heroku:\r\n\r\n1. Authenticate via the Heroku command line, `heroku login`\r\n2. Set your environment variables on Heroku\r\n    * If you've already setup your `.env` file as documented above, simply run `heroku config:push`\r\n    * Otherwise you can run the following command:\r\n    `heroku config:set DATABASE_URL=postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>?ssl=true`\r\n    Then run `heroku config:push`\r\n3. Push your code up to your Heroku app\r\n4. You're done!\r\n\r\n## Modifying site content\r\n\r\n* The `jade` directory contains files for various markup files used to generate web pages.\r\n* The `controllers` directory contains files for specific functionality for views, along with the files in `routes` for how they're invoked.\r\n* Add additional frontend assets to the `public` directory, then reference them in the files found in `jade/includes`, particularly `head.jade` and `scripts.jade`\r\n\r\n## Running the tests\r\n\r\n* Make sure your environment is setup to run [Zombie.js](http://zombie.labnotes.org/#Infection)\r\n* With foreman\r\n    * run `foreman run npm test` from the root directory of this repository\r\n* Without foreman\r\n    * run `npm test`\r\n\r\n## Validating JS and Jade files\r\n\r\n* Run `grunt`\r\n\r\n# Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [foundation v3.1.1](https://github.com/twbs/foundation/releases/tag/v3.1.1)\r\n* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)\r\n* For other dependencies see [package.json](package.json)\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\n\r\n* When in doubt, create an issue!\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nYou can most easily reach me on twitter [@_Shakeel](http://twitter.com/_Shakeel)\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the terms of [the MIT license](LICENSE)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
